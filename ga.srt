because of your arrogance.

he stole...

Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?

363
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,907
I'm not gonna
answer to "Star-Munch."

00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,826

talking about this for?

a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!

368
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,708

369

00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,753
A little
one-inch man saved us?

371
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,173
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be
much larger.

I'm not a fool, Nebula.

385

You are a fool if
you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.

386
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,871
You'll attack me

would make that obvious.

To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

Something to make
the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

887
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,483
Anyways, happy trails.

888
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:27,496
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

889
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:30,166
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought
she was delusional.

890
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,792
Peter...

891
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:33,251
Listen, I'd love to
believe all of this,
I really would.

892
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,795
But you left...

893
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,840
the most
wonderful woman ever...

894
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:39,466
to die alone.

895
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:43,012
I didn't want to
leave your mother, Peter.

896
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,347
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

897
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,932
and the light within it...

898
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,642
this form will
wither and perish.

899
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,853
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

900
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,189
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

901
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,191
I loved your mother,
Peter!

902
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,818
I couldn't stand
to set foot on an Earth...

903
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,153
where she wasn't living!

904
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,821
You can't imagine
what that's like!

905
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,365
I know exactly
what that feels like!

906
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,159
I had to watch her die!

907
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,792
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

908
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,129
I've made many mistakes,
Peter.

909
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,423
But you're not one of them.

910
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,052
Please give me the chance
to be the father

911
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,929
she would want me to be.

912
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:35,064
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

913
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:37,149
and the light within.

914
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:40,402
They are a part of you,
Peter.

915
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:42,947
What do you mean?

916
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,616
Give me your hands, son.

917
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,701
Here.

918
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,454
Hold them like that.

919
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,338
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

920
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,508
Take your brain
to the center
of this planet.

921

923
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,431
Yes!

Yes!

925
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,392
Whoa!

926
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,936
Yes! It's okay.

927
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,187
Just relax.
Concentrate.

928
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,439
You can do it.
Bring it back.

929
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:18,983
Yes!

930
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,737
Yes, now shape it.

931
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,489
Feel that energy.

932
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,661
Yes.

933
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,332
You're home.

934
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,962

He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

939
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,969
So you're a pet?

940
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,471
I suppose.

941
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,517
People usually
want cute pets.

942
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,936
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?

943
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,355
I am hideous?

944
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,690
You are horrifying
to look at. Yes.

945
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:46,028
But that's a good thing.

946
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,363
Oh?

947
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,114
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...

948
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,700
you know they love
you for who you are.

949

Beautiful people never know
who to trust.

950

certainly grateful to be ugly.

There's something
I must tell you.

960

What's going on?

961
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,439
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

can you show us

MANTIS: The planet is Ego.

00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,165
A dog would not invite a flea

00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,292
And you're not a flea?

971
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,669
I'm a flea with a purpose.

972
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:29,047
I help him sleep.

973
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:32,259
What were you
about to say to Drax
before I walked out?

974
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:38,432
Nothing.

975
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,185

are this way.

No, Gef.

00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,178
It's too adorable to kill.

986

No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

988
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:30,108
I was a Kree battle
slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.

989
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,447
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.

990
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:40,035
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

991
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,870
But I was young...

992
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,291
and greedy, and stupid.

993
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,503
Like you stealing
those batteries.

994
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,088

995
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:56,968
Me and Stakar and
the other captains...

996
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,388
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,224
The only family
I ever had.

998
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,310
When I broke the code...

999
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:09,231
they exiled me.

1000
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,192
This is what I deserve.

1001
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,027
Slow down, drama queen.

1002
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,820

but I don't.

with his old man.

-Ego?
-Yeah.

Why didn't you
deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?

1014
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,142
He was skinny.

1015
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:49,396

No. I saved your life.

doesn't have enough power

1414
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,007

1420
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,066
the most beguiling was...

1421
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,694
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

1422
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,739
I hoped the result
of such a coupling
would be enough...

1423
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,658
to power the Expansion.

1424
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,327
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1425
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,998
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated
him generously...

1426
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,752
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1427

I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1428
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:43,008
But one after the other,
they failed me.

1429

the Celestial genes.

the connection to the light.
